Laboratory Scripts and Classes for Quantum Devices Electrical Characterization
and Data Analysis.

This repository includes classes and scripts to execute electrical and
thermoelectric measurements on nanoscale devices, including but not limiting to:

- Quantum devices in a field-effect configuration, such as molecular junctions,
  quantum wire, quantum well and 2D materials.
- Vertically stacked heterostructures, such as Van der Waals heterostructures.
- Field effect transistors.

The repository includes an expandable instrumentation library to dialogue with
several electronic measuring equipment. The communication between the
instruments and the local computer is established via PyVisa.

The repository is currently under development.
