Laboratory Scripts and Classes for Quantum Devices Eletrical Characterization and Data Analysis

This repository includes classes and scripts to execute electrical and thermoelecric measurements of quantum devices in a field-effect configuration and of vertically stacked heterostructures. The repository includes an expandable instrumentation library to dialogue with several electronic measuring equipment. The communication between the instruments and the local computer is established via PyVisa.
